    <h1>Grilled Cheese</h1>

   <p>No matter the hour (or your age), a grilled cheese sandwich is the pinnacle of crave-worthiness. 
    This rendition doesn’t attempt to reinvent the classic. It just guides you toward making the best-ever
    version of it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p><ul>
        <li>2 slices ½”-thick Pullman or other white bread</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 thinly sliced American cheese or cheddar (about 4 slices)</li> 
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <p><ol>
        <li>Place bread on a cutting board and spread mayonnaise over top side of each; this is 
            key to a golden, delectable crunch.</li>
        <li>eat a small skillet (nonstick, ideally) over medium. Slide in half of butter. When it melts, place 1 slice of bread, 
            mayonnaise side down, in skillet; top with cheese; season with pepper. 
            Top with second slice of bread, mayonnaise side up.</li>
        <li>When underside is golden brown, about 4 minutes, turn sandwich and add 
            remaining butter to skillet. Press down on sandwich to encourage even browning and to help melt 
            cheese—be gentle, don’t smash it.</li>
        <li>Cook until second side is golden brown and cheese is melted. Eat immediately, preferably with soup.</li>
    </ol></p>
