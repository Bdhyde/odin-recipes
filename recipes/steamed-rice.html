    <p>Tired of burnt rice? Mushy rice? Undercooked rice? Cooking rice seems simple enough, but a lot can go wrong! 
        That may sound like the prelude to an infomercial, but it’s true! While Sarah’s already published her <a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/how-to-cook-rice-without-a-rice-cooker/"> 
        for cooking rice without a rice cooker, </a> I’ll teach you another foolproof method…how to steam rice!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p><ul>
        <li>1/2 cup white rice <em>(such as jasmine; about 95g)</em></li>
        <li>2/3 cup water <em>(155ml)</em></li>
    </ul></p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p><ol>
        <li>The rice to water ratio should be: 1 (rice) : 1.3 (water). 
            can make it 1:1.5 if you like your rice soft.
            your rice for at least 10 minutes. 
            Drain and transfer to a shallow, heat-proof container that will fit in your 
            steamer,
            add the water to the rice. Everyone has their own preferences when it comes to the rice texture they like!
            Also, if you're making short grain rice, you can reduce the ratio to 1:1.1. </li> 
    <p></p>
        <li> Place in a steamer filled with cold water (the water should not be boiling when the rice is placed into the steamer).</li>
    <p></p>    
        <li>Turn on the heat to high, cover, and cook for 20 minutes. Turn off the heat, and let the rice sit in the steamer 
            with the lid on for at least 5 more minutes. You can also keep it in there to stay warm until you’re ready to serve.</li>
